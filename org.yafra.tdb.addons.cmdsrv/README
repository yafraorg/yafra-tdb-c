This is the Command server daemon which replaces the system() command 
in applications.

The aim is to avoid duplication of code of big programs.

Version whith named pipes: fifo


1. Software
============

Includes: 
$(PISOINC)/cmdmsg.h

cmdback.c        /* put server daemon in background unter init process      */
cmdmain.c        /* main functions of server                                */
cmdoperation.c   /* read write operations                                   */
cmdserver.c      /* server tasking part                                     */
program name: piserver


Test can be performed with:
cmdclient.c      /* client test programm reading stdin and sending to server*/
program name: piclient

The pipe buffers reside in /tmp   FIFO.1 and FIFO.2 
The binaries must be copied in /usr/local/bin 




2. Usage
=========

Marco polo:
-----------

Earlier output programs called "system(..)" to execute a task. 
This call is replaced by CMDclientSystem() which is the client part sending
the command to the command server "piserver".

When starting "./MARCO -daemon"  start also  "./piserver -daemon"
