<H1>command server</H1>
This program is a background daemon that listens to sockets or
fifo (named pipes). You can write a normal system() command to
the socket/fifos. The daemon executes that command with uid/gid
set like also sent on the sockets/fifos. A log file reports on
the commands, see <B><CODE>/tmp/CMDlog</CODE></B>.
<H3>client function for your program</H3>
Replace your system() calls with
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/manpage?3+PSSYSexecute">PSSYSexecute()</A> and from then
your progis are started by the command server !
<H3>start it from /etc/rc</H3>
Put this code in your /etc/rc to start psfifo at boot up:
<PRE>
# start CMDSRV system() server
 if [ -x /work/bin/psfifo ]
 then
   echo "starting yafra.org system() server"
